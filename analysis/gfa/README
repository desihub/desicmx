Notebooks for GFA Commissioning Analysis:
 - GFA-Zero-Calibration: analyze zeros to calculate master bias residual images and estimate readnoise per amplifier.
 - GFA-Flat-Calibration: analyze dome flats with increasing exposure times to estimate gain per amplifier.
 - GFA-Dark-Calibration: analyze 5s darks to estimate dark current temperature dependence parameters and calculate master dark images.
 
All results are saved in a single FITS file. For details, see DESI-5315.  Notebooks use code from https://github.com/dkirkby/desietcimg.
